# Assignment 1


In this assignment, I've developed an ASCII-based function plotter. 
The objective of this assignment was to practice array indexing and slicing, 
conditionals, loops, and other concepts introduced in the first two weeks
of the bootcamp. The plotter I've developed can be useful for visualizing
the shape of any function on text-based environments (e.g., command-line
applications) but is not designed to replace plotting utilities such
as matplotlib.
